Repo containing my public presentations. To view a particular slide deck, go to the companion [GitHup repo](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/presentations) and look at the directory folders. The rendered slides will be available at www.grantmcdermott.com/presentations/DIR/slides.html (replace DIR with the directory of interest).
